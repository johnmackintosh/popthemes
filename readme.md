## What?

This is a collection of colour palettes based on 90s pop album covers.

Some of these appeared frequently in web searches, so they must be good.

Featuring:

-   Aqua
-   Bangles
-   Beck
-   Betty Boo
-   Breeders
-   B\*Witched
-   Deee Lite
-   Hole
-   No Doubt
-   S Club 7
-   Spice Girls
-   Steps

## Why?

Because[I’ve done
Metallica](https://github.com/johnmackintosh/metallicaRt) and [classic
rock](https://github.com/johnmackintosh/rockthemes).

Although rockthemes has some pop acts in it as well, including No Doubt
and DeeeLite, who also appear here. Don’t worry about it.

This will probably not go to CRAN, so please install using the remotes
package.
